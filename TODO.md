TODO
===============
    * improve genericity of costMatrix()
    * move mmc into this package
    * implement mmcLP if possible
    * implement hmmc (hierachical max margin clustering) if possible
    * implement hmmcLP if possible
    * implement all loss functions to accept matrices
    * require the return value of loss functions to include the evaluation point w, and return this object in nrbm. 
      This modification will allow the loss functions to return objects of a specific class so that predict() function can be implemented for each loss
